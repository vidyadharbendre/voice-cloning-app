## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Repository Pattern
Used in file management for abstracting data access.

### 2. Strategy Pattern
Different TTS engines can be plugged in through the ITTSEngine interface.

### 3. Dependency Injection
Services are injected through FastAPI's dependency system.

### 4. Factory Pattern
Service creation is handled through dependency factories.

### 5. Singleton Pattern
Configuration is managed as a singleton instance.

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- AudioProcessor only handles audio operations
- FileManager only handles file operations
- TTSEngine only handles text-to-speech synthesis

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- New TTS engines can be added by implementing ITTSEngine
- New audio processors can be added by implementing IAudioProcessor
- System is open for extension, closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Any implementation of ITTSEngine can replace another
- Interface contracts are maintained across implementations

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Separate interfaces for different concerns (TTS, Audio Processing, File Management)
- Clients depend only on interfaces they use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions
- VoiceCloningService depends on interfaces, not implementations

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New TTS Engine

1. Create new engine class implementing `ITTSEngine`:

```python
from app.interfaces.tts_interface import ITTSEngine

class NewTTSEngine(ITTSEngine):
    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        # Initialize your engine
        pass
    
    async def synthesize(self, text: str, language: str, output_path: str, **kwargs):
        # Implement synthesis
        pass
    
    async def clone_voice(self, text: str, reference_audio_path: str, output_path: str, language: str, **kwargs):
        # Implement voice cloning
        pass
```

2. Register in dependencies:

```python
def get_new_tts_engine() -> NewTTSEngine:
    return NewTTSEngine()
```

### Adding New Audio Processing Features

1. Extend `IAudioProcessor` interface if needed
2. Implement in `AudioProcessor` or create new implementation
3. Update dependency injection

### Adding New API Endpoints

1. Define request/response models in `schemas.py`
2. Add route in `routes.py`
3. Implement business logic in appropriate service

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Test Coverage
```bash
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

### Adding Tests
- Unit tests for services in `tests/test_services.py`
- API tests in `tests/test_api.py`
- Integration tests for complete workflows

## Code Quality

### Linting
```bash
flake8 app/
black app/
isort app/
```

### Type Checking
```bash
mypy app/
```

## Performance Optimization

### GPU Acceleration
- Ensure CUDA is available for PyTorch
- Set `USE_GPU=true` in environment variables
- Monitor GPU memory usage

### Caching
- Consider implementing Redis for model caching
- Cache frequently used voice embeddings
- Implement response caching for identical requests

### Async Operations
- All I/O operations are async
- Use async file operations with aiofiles
- Non-blocking model inference where possible

## Deployment

### Development
```bash
python run.py
```

### Production
```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for all configuration options.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Health Checks
- `/api/v1/health` endpoint for monitoring
- Model status and GPU availability

### Logging
- Structured logging with appropriate levels
- Error tracking and performance metrics
- Request/response logging

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- File type and size validation
- Text length limits
- Audio format validation

### File Security
- Temporary file cleanup
- Secure file storage
- No executable file uploads

### API Security
- Rate limiting (implement in production)
- CORS configuration
- Input sanitization
